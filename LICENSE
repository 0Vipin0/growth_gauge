GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with
two steps: (1) asserting copyright on the software, and (2) offering you
this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL licenses are also
designed to make sure that others do not try to prevent you from sharing
copies of the software or to ask you to surrender your rights.

Specifically, the Affero General Public License is a modified version of
the ordinary GNU General Public License, designed to address the problem
of software run over a network without transfer of an executable file.

The GNU Affero General Public License is applicable to any software which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying that it may be
distributed under the terms of this GNU Affero General Public License.

You should also have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

1. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may
be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
meets this criterion.

2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions
are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run
the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered
by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered
work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without condition so long as your copyright otherwise remains intact. You
may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those
thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on
your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them
from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
parties' legal rights to stop activities that otherwise would infringe your
copyright.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added under
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will thus apply,
along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole, and
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives
no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
not make them do so.

e) You must cause any covered work to notify all users that interact
with it remotely through a computer network (if the work is an application
program) that the source code of the work is available to those users by
means of a network-accessible mechanism at no charge, other than the
cost of obtaining network access. This notification must be made at least
as prominent as the notice of copyright.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a physical
distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a
durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a physical
distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least
three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object
code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more
than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network
server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(in some countries this counts as a public exhibition) and offer access
to the Corresponding Source from the same place.

e) Install the object code on a user's machine or provide access to run
a covered work on a server, and offer the user access to the
Corresponding Source by means of a network-accessible mechanism at no
charge, other than the cost of obtaining network access, when the user
is prompted to interact with the covered work. Each user that interacts
with the covered work is legally entitled to receive the Corresponding
Source for that work under the terms of this section. If the object code
is run on a server and the covered work has a user interface through a
web browser or other similar client, the Corresponding Source must be
made available to the user interacting with the client. An appropriate
network-accessible mechanism, for example, could be a link or instruction
in a prominent place in the user interface to a repository containing
the Corresponding Source.

A "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and to
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
it does not include the work's operating system, or generally available
system libraries, or generally available tools or compilers used to
develop the work.

For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control
flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form must be provided
in a format that is not deliberately obfuscated, and must be the preferred
form for making modifications.

7. Additional Terms

"Additional permissions" are terms that augment the terms of this License
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part
of the Program, that part may be used under those permissions alone,
provided the entire Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
any additional permissions from that copy. (Additional permissions may be
written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the
work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to
a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
ways as different from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors
and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
may add the material to a covered work, provided that you remove the
further restriction when you do so.

8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the first paragraph of section
11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material
under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Accessing

You are not required to accept this License in order to run the Program.
Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
of using an interactive user interface to another covered work is also not
required to be accepted. However, nothing other than this License grants
you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses the party's
predecessor had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor,
if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
any portion of it.

11. Patents

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making, using, or
selling, the contributor's version, but do not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor's
version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,
sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
contents of its contributor version.

In the three paragraphs above, a patent license is granted only for the
contributor's version and modified versions of that version. A patent
license is not granted for other works produced by incorporating only
portions of that version into other works.

This License does not hasten the release of the requirement under an
otherwise valid patent license to pay royalties if that release is not
already available under this License.

If you convey a covered work, you waive any right to seek to recover
customary and reasonable royalty from a recipient for the exercise of the
rights granted by this License to that recipient's covered works.

12. No Waiver of Other Systemic Risk

If you have been granted permission to copy, modify or distribute the
Program pursuant to a sublicense or other contract to which section 10
applies, and as a result of that sublicense or contract you become a party
to a legal agreement which provides that you may not exercise any of the
rights granted to you under this License (or exercise them only subject to
onerous limitations), then you may not convey (or modify or propagate to
convey) the Program. However, if you are also in compliance with that
sublicense or contract, then the provisions of section 10 will not apply
to the conveyance, and you will not have to comply with any other aspect
of this License.

13. Distribution of outside of the Scope of this License

If the Program's requirements do not include a specific requirement to
comply with a given law, this License does not obligate you to comply
with that law.

14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a certain version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, and you want to use a
version of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may do so, as long
as the GPL version specified is one that would be compatible with that
version, or a later version, of the GNU Affero General Public License.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
